Morset
======

I didn't solve this one, but I at least wanted to share a Morse Code / Characters conversion program. It accepts any form of space-separated characters or Morse dots and dashes, and even at the same time. I found an existing alpha-Morse conversion dictionary online, but I also added a line that added the Morse-alpha conversions, that way a dictionary call to either will return the opposite representation.

Use the program by running it in Python and then entering space-separated characters or Morse codes. It'll run as an endless loop.
