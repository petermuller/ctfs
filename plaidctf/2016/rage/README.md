Rage Against the Machine
========================

View the IPython Notebook file for a writeup around the networkbreaker.py script. This directory contains a few scripts I used for trying to (unsuccessfully) brute force an image that would pass the neural network check. The 'plaid' directory contains some images I downloaded from Google image search, that happened to work in this challenge.
